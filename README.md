Symfony Bundle to integrate [Tactician Domain Events library](https://bornfreee.github.io/tactician-domain-events/) with Symfony project

Installation
------------

Install via composer

```bash
composer require bornfreee/tactician-domain-events-bundle
```

Add bundle to `AppKernel.php`:

```php
$bundles = [
    // ...
    new \BornFree\TacticianDomainEventBundle\TacticianDomainEventBundle(),
];
```

Configuration
-----

On default event collector `CollectsEventsFromEntities` will be used, but sometimes you might record an event when entity doesn't change so the event is not collected.
It's also true when an aggregate root is recording events for its child entities. To collect those events you need to use `CollectsEventsFromAllEntitiesManagedByUnitOfWork`
That one collects events from all entities which are managed by Unit of Work. To use it you need to set `collect_from_all_managed_entities` on true:

```yaml
tactician_domain_event:
    collect_from_all_managed_entities: true # it's false on default
```

Usage
-----

This bundle allows you to automatically have Domain Events dispatched by `EventDispatcher`. It also allows to register event listeners and subscribers as the Symfony Services.
You can register as many listeners as you want for each Domain Event.

First, we need to install the Tactician official Bundle to integrate the command bus library:

```php
composer require league/tactician-bundle
```

Then we need to configure Middleware to automatically record the Domain Events and dispatch them.
We only want to handle the events themselves *after* the command has completely and successfully been handled. So we add the middleware that records the Domain Events *before* the Transaction middleware.

It means that as soon as transaction is completed, the Domain Events will be recorded:

```yaml
tactician:
    commandbus:
        default:
            middleware:
                # other middlewares...
                - tactician_domain_events.middleware.release_recorded_events # make sure to add it before `tactician.middleware.doctrine` 
                - tactician.middleware.doctrine
                - tactician.middleware.command_handler
```

### Configuring Event Listeners

In order to add event listeners for dispatched Domain Events, we need to define services and the corresponded commands for them:

```yaml
app.listener.send_email:
    class: AppBundle\EventListener\SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener
    tags:
        - { name: tactician.event_listener, event: App\Domain\Events\UserWasCreated }
```

Notice the tag `tactician.event_listener`. The bundle automatically finds all services tagged with this tag and adds the listener to `EventDispatcher`.

By default, event listener shold have public `__invoke` function. If you want to have regular method name, it's possible to it to the service configuration:

```yaml
app.listener.send_email:
    class: AppBundle\EventListener\SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener
    tags:
        - { name: tactician.event_listener, event: App\Domain\Events\UserWasCreated, method: send }
```

This is all configuration you need to start using the Tactician command bus with Domain Events.

Let's have an example where we create a new user and a `UserWasCreated` domain event is dispatched:

```php
class User implements ContainsRecordedEvents
{
    use EventRecorderCapabilities;

    public function __construct($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;

        $this->record(new UserWasCreated($name));
    }

    // ...
}
```
As soon as this `Entity` is successfully created, the `SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener` will be triggered.

### Map Based On Typehints
Rather than repeating the command's full class name, we can also reflect on the Handler's method typehints.

```yaml
app.listener.send_email:
    class: AppBundle\EventListener\SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener
    tags:
        - { name: tactician.event_listener, typhints: true }
```

This detects what commands this handler receives by inspecting the class' methods. The rules for matching are:

1. The method must be public.
2. The method must accept only one parameter.
3. The parameter must be typehinted with a class name.

If you have multiple commands going into a single handler, they will all be detected, provided they follow the rules above. The actual name of the method is NOT important.

In other words, the SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener class should look like this:

```php
<?php
class SendEmailAfterUserIsCreatedListener
{
    public function handleRegisterUser(RegisterUser $command)
    {
       // do stuff
    }
    
    public function handleUserWasCreated(UserWasCreated $command)
    {
       // do stuff
    }
}
```
### Debugging

You can run the `debug:tactician-domain-events` command to get a list of all events with mapped listeners.
